## üéâ **Results**

The Street Light Analytics system now provides **genuinely different, realistic lighting data for each city** that reflects their actual infrastructure, operational patterns, and maintenance needs. When users switch between cities, they see completely different lighting zones, fault patterns, energy consumption, and smart feature configurations that make sense for each specific location's lighting management requirements.

This implementation transforms the Street Light section from basic monitoring into a comprehensive, city-aware lighting management platform that rivals professional municipal lighting management systems! ‚ú®üèôÔ∏è
