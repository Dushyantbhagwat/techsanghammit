# Bucket Name Fix Applied

## 🔧 **Issue Resolved: Incorrect Bucket Name**

**Problem:** The Hazards component was configured to use bucket name `hazard-images` but the actual Supabase bucket is named `images`.

**Solution:** Updated all references to use the correct bucket name `images`.

## ✅ **Files Updated:**

### **1. Core Configuration**
- **`src/lib/supabase.ts`**
  - Changed `HAZARDS_BUCKET = 'hazard-images'` → `HAZARDS_BUCKET = 'images'`

### **2. Service Layer**
- **`src/services/hazards.ts`**
  - Updated console logging to reflect correct bucket name
  - All fetch operations now target the `images` bucket

### **3. Sample Data Generation**
- **`src/utils/sampleHazardData.ts`**
  - Removed bucket creation logic since `images` bucket already exists
  - Updated to work with existing bucket

### **4. Testing Utilities**
- **`src/utils/quickStorageTest.ts`**
  - Prioritized `images` bucket in test sequence
  - Updated bucket existence checks
  - Fixed public URL generation tests

### **5. Debug Component**
- **`src/components/debug/SupabaseDebugger.tsx`**
  - Updated bucket check logic for `images` bucket
  - Removed bucket creation attempts
  - Updated test messages and labels

## 🚀 **Expected Results:**

Now that the bucket name is corrected, the Hazards component should:

✅ **Successfully connect** to your `images` bucket  
✅ **Retrieve uploaded images** from Supabase storage  
✅ **Display images** in both grid and list views  
✅ **Show proper metadata** and geolocation information  
✅ **Enable filtering and sorting** of hazard reports  

## 🔍 **Verification Steps:**

1. **Refresh the Hazards page** in your application
2. **Check browser console** for successful data loading messages:
   ```
   Fetching hazard images from bucket: images (images bucket)
   Raw data from storage: [your uploaded files]
   Total files found: X
   Valid image files after filtering: X
   ✅ Hazard data loaded: { totalImages: X, ... }
   ```
3. **Images should now appear** in the Hazards interface
4. **Use the debugger** if needed - it should show all green checkmarks

## 📋 **What Changed:**

**Before:**
- Component looked for bucket: `hazard-images` ❌
- Your actual bucket: `images` ✅
- Result: No images found (bucket mismatch)

**After:**
- Component looks for bucket: `images` ✅
- Your actual bucket: `images` ✅
- Result: Images retrieved successfully ✅

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the application** - images should now load properly
2. **Upload additional images** to the `images` bucket if needed
3. **Use the filtering and sorting features** to organize hazard reports
4. **Remove the debugger** from the Hazards page once everything is working

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist:**

If images still don't appear after this fix:

1. **Run the debugger** to check for other issues
2. **Verify bucket permissions** (should be public)
3. **Check image file formats** (JPEG, PNG, WebP supported)
4. **Ensure files are in the root** of the `images` bucket
5. **Check browser console** for any remaining error messages

The bucket name mismatch was likely the primary issue preventing image retrieval. With this fix applied, your Hazards component should now successfully display all uploaded images from your Supabase `images` bucket! 🎉
